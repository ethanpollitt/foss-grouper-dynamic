1) Code organization
	a) written in C, good documentation
		* Good inline comments
		* Good README file
	b) pol_gen.c - generates random policies for grouper to use
		* uses rand() function (seeded with time of day) to generate random IP 
			addresses for policy rules
		* inserts wild card symbols randomly as well
		* 
	c) bigtest.py - Python control file to kick off a "big test"
		* Takes parameters from user
		* Uses pol_gen.c to generate policies for testing
		* Kicks off grouper with the generated policies
